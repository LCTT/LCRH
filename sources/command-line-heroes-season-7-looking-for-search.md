Command Line Heroes: Season 7: Looking for Search
======
**00:00** - _Saron Yitbarek_

It's the winter of 1995. You're an early adopter cruising the internet for all the latest details on, I don't know, Pixar's new movie _Toy Story,_ or maybe NASA's Galileo Space Probe. The world wide web is your oyster because a brand new tech has arrived that lets you search for anything online. It's unlike anything that came before. There's a flood of information at your fingertips, and now you can navigate it with total ease. This website for searching other websites is going to change the world. It's got a weird name, but who cares? You type it in and smile: altavista.com.

**00:50** - _Saron Yitbarek_

All season we've been looking into the tech breakthroughs that made 1995 one of the most extraordinary years on record. It was the year the dot-com bubble began and 16 million internet users suddenly showed up. With their arrival came a flood of new content, and with that flood came a pressing new need, the need for navigation.

**01:15** - _Saron Yitbarek_

How do you follow every thread in a world wide web? How do you find that crucial piece of information you've been hunting for? At each point in history, we've had to invent new ways to organize our data. The more data we got, the more creative we had to get. In ancient times, we invented alphabetical order, indexes, and tables of contents so we could find what we needed in books. More modern inventions, like the Dewey Decimal System organized huge libraries of knowledge. But digging through something as giant as the world wide web required an invention more powerful than anything that had come before. And 1995 was the year that invention arrived.

**02:04** - _Saron Yitbarek_

I'm Saron Yitbarek and this is Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat. As of the year 2020, there were close to 5 billion internet users on the planet. 5 billion people, posting content, tagging themselves, streaming videos, writing posts, and researching term papers. To get it all done they searched through more than 4 billion web pages. That's a lot of content. For perspective the New York Public Library system has just 55 million items. Our ability to sort through all that content isn't just convenient, it's fundamental. Without a way to search the web, the web as we know it would not work. In fact, before 1995, there really wasn't a good way to search.

**02:55** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

And I actually even have a book that I used to write down websites in so that I could help people at the cyber cafe find things that they wanted.

**03:06** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Elizabeth Van Couvering is an Assistant Professor in Media and Communications at the University of Karlstad. She's been studying the history of search engines for about as long as they've been around. And she describes the early web as a flat and static place with a bunch of directories to help you find your way. The first directory was made in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee himself. He called it the Virtual Library. Sounds impressive, but it was honestly just a list of sites. New websites were sent to Berners-Lee and he posts links on his library page, organizing them into categories like Anthropology and Bio Sciences. He was getting, at most, a hundred visits a day. But early web directories like that? They were updated manually.

**03:54** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

In Yahoo's early state, there were editors who kept a list.

**04:01** - _Saron Yitbarek_

There was also InfoSeek where webmasters manually submitted their pages for inclusion. But web search, as we know it, hasn't yet evolved.

**04:10** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

It soon became apparent that the work was not very possible actually. It simply wasn't possible to do it on a human scale because you just needed too many people and there still was no funding.

**04:27** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Van Couvering's point about funding is an important one. In the early days, most people didn't understand what search was going to become, so there wasn't much money behind the idea. The internet was a niche, not quite a global phenomenon. And the idea you could get enough traffic at a search site to make money through ads, which maybe seems obvious today, was not so obvious back then. That early site InfoSeek, for example, tried a subscription model selling access to their list of websites for 10 bucks a month, and you were limited to 100 searches each month.

**05:05** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

These companies we're searching all the time for what was going to be the business model.

**05:13** - _Saron Yitbarek_

That problem, finding the right business model for search, was going to take a long time to solve. We'll get back to it later. But in the meantime, there was another problem. How do you get a technology that's useful enough? That's good enough to actually sell?

**05:29** - _Louis Monier_

Too much demand and not enough supply.

**05:31** - _Saron Yitbarek_

That's Louis Monier. A true web pioneer. He told us how back in the early 90s, only a tiny fraction of the internet was indexed by anybody. On top of that, nobody had a handle on how fast this thing was growing. Partly, it was a hardware problem. Machines were underperforming and people were getting timeout responses when they tried to search.

**05:54** - _Louis Monier_

As a user of the early internet, I was frustrated with what was available.

**05:58** - _Saron Yitbarek_

At the time, Monier worked in a research lab at Digital Equipment Corporation, better known as DEC, along with computer scientists, Paul Flaherty and Michael Burrows. The team had seen the Mosaic browser, which arrived in 1994. They'd seen the easiness of Mosaic, its usability, and it inspired them to start thinking about other tools that could make the web more usable. A search tool was front of mind. It was not, though, front of mind for all their bosses at DEC.

**06:30** - _Louis Monier_

The management was sort of confused for a while, because this didn't look like anything they knew. So there were a few people who were sufficiently interested in change that they understood what it was, and they took the bet that this was actually going to turn big, but most people were just really confused. What is it? How are you going to sell it? Who's going to use it? Why do people care?

**07:00** - _Saron Yitbarek_

One of the DEC folks who did believe that search was worth pursuing with a DEC product engineer named Paul Cormier. His job was to help promote the new creations that came out of their research labs.

**07:14** - _Paul Cormier_

Digital was looking for ways to commercialize some of their more interesting research technologies, and so way back then, they started an organization to look at trying to productize some of these interesting research projects—so actually embedding product engineers into the research groups, to try to look at promising ones that we would bring to market, and I was the first one that started that group.

**07:42** - _Saron Yitbarek_

At the time, DEC was the second-largest computer company in the world, after IBM. And like IBM, they prided themselves on funding their own research. They had 4 major labs, like the one where Monier worked.

**07:57** - _Paul Cormier_

Digital had a huge research organization. The researchers could really do anything that they thought was interesting with what their background was, and so the researchers in Palo Alto started “search” because it was just interesting at the time.

**08:17** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Search was interesting because it hadn't yet been done in a big enough way. And the team at DEC came to realize they had a chance to deliver something new, a first real search engine for everyday users. They called it AltaVista.

**08:31** - _Louis Monier_

I remember being, like, in the spring of 95, just laying on a mattress by the pool and taking notes about how we design something to do that. And then by the 4th of July 1995, I was starting to crawl the internet.

**08:57** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Did you catch that term Monier used? Crawl the internet? A web crawler—or a spider they’re sometimes called—is a program that crawls over the web and indexes everything it finds. You start on, say, the Yahoo homepage. Your program analyzes what's there, finds all the links, and then follows those links. On the new web page, you repeat. From link to link, you crawl the whole world wide web, or that's the idea. Trouble is, all the crawlers back in 1995 couldn't keep up with how fast the web was expanding.

**09:34** - _Louis Monier_

Most web crawlers were what's called single fed, meaning they were doing things one after the other. So fetch a web page, analyze the links, note those links somewhere, pick the next link, fetch that page, keep going.

**09:51** - _Saron Yitbarek_

But if you're crawling to one link at a time, you can only do maybe 20,000 sites in a day. So when Monier built his crawler, it wasn't going to be single-threaded.

**10:02** - _Louis Monier_

I wrote a web crawler that didn't do one thing at a time, it did literally 1000 things at a time. It had a thousand threads. So think of them as little programs that work next to each other independently, and each would fetch a page and then go to sleep, and let someone else use the computer while waiting for the answer, and that worked really well. So it was basically working a thousand times faster than other web crawlers.

**10:31** - _Saron Yitbarek_

That crawler, which they called Scooter, was one of several advances built into AltaVista. It was the first search engine to index the entire text of each web page—the first to allow searches of images, audio and video.

**10:48** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Two years after launch, it even had a translation feature called Babel Fish, which massively increased the number of pages you could make sense of. All these features were being utilized to hunt through hundreds of millions of pages. And thanks to DEC's line of alpha 64-bit microprocessors, AltaVista could work at speeds that made searching feel as easy as thinking.

**11:15** - _Louis Monier_

So it would spawn in a fraction of a second, which people had just never experienced.

**11:19** - _Saron Yitbarek_

By the fall of 1995, Monier had released an internal version of the search engine to the staff at DEC. And they seemed to like it.

**11:28** - _Louis Monier_

I had no idea how much people were starting to rely on it until one night I turn off the machine in order to, I don't know, reload a new version or something like this, and my inbox just explodes with messages of people saying "Turn it back on. I can’t do without this."

**11:44** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Louis Monier's team had taken the idea of search, and turned it into something indispensable. Next, AltaVista became available to the public in December of 1995. And within a couple of years, there were 80 million users.

**12:01** - _Louis Monier_

AltaVista probably accelerated development of modern search engines by a few years. It was sort of worldwide. Everybody was using AltaVista. So I guess that's the thing I'm the most proud of, by pushing the envelope a lot, not a little bit.

**12:19** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Richard Seltzer is a novelist these days, but he worked at DEC for 19 years. When AltaVista was first released, it was Seltzer they called on to write a book, explaining the value of search.

**12:31** - _Richard Seltzer_

Part of the fun I had in writing the book and in making speeches about everything was pointing out to people that the capabilities they had in their hands and they had no idea that it was there.

**12:42** - _Saron Yitbarek_

His book was called the AltaVista Search Revolution and it was a revolution they were talking about. While researching his book, Seltzer began to see something profound in what Monier had done. The switch from old databases to jet-fueled indexes was a game changer.

**13:02** - _Richard Seltzer_

Before AltaVista came along, if you wanted to find something, you had to categorize it and put it neatly into a database before you'd ever be able to get anything out. The problem with databases was databases being based on categories, and categories being based on what you know of the world today and how you think of the world today. But the problem is the world doesn't stay still.

**13:31** - _Saron Yitbarek_

The older database approach only worked if you knew how things were organized in the first place, but the index approach allowed the automated retrieval of whatever you wanted, and that meant everything was yours to discover.

**13:47** - _Richard Seltzer_

It was being able to find the needle in the haystack without touching the haystack.

**13:51** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Seltzer's book opened a door for people revealing, not just the power of search, but the flip side of that coin, the power of search engine optimization. Of course they didn't have that term yet. He called it-

**14:06** - _Richard Seltzer_

Fly paper.

**14:08** - _Saron Yitbarek_

See what he did there? Because flies get caught in webs, but sticky fly paper catches even more flies. Okay maybe SEO is better, but Seltzer deserves credit for seeing that search was going to be about more than just ordinary users. It would be about businesses, too.

**14:25** - _Richard Seltzer_

Sometimes the best way to find that unique person or set of people out there isn't to search for them but rather just set up web pages that lead to them finding you through their searches.

**14:40** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Not everybody at DEC saw that search had a business angle. In fact, they didn't know what they had. They didn't quite get it.

**14:48** - _Louis Monier_

At heart, it was a hardware company with an image of technology that was rooted in the past.

**14:57** - _Saron Yitbarek_

And that meant, amazing as AltaVista was, it never had a long horizon. Being a leader in the field doesn't mean much if you don't know what you're selling.

**15:07** - _Louis Monier_

So there was no more interest in this, and we sort of ran out of steam, and that literally is when Google started.

**15:21** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Elizabeth Van Couvering told us a series of business failures caused AltaVista to sink after a few years at the top of the search pack. First and foremost, they failed to monetize while others were not so shy.

**15:36** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

In about 1996, Yahoo began to take advertising and everything became different. People really, really, really needed a funding model.

**15:51** - _Saron Yitbarek_

By this point, Yahoo had outgrown their old directory days. They were indexing the web, just like AltaVista, and they found a way to make money at it, too.

**16:02** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Then in 1997, a series of mergers took place. Big players came to realize that search was the future. Some of the biggest companies in media were swallowing up the search startups. Disney, for example, bought InfoSeek. And who bought AltaVista? Well, their parent company DEC was bought by the computer company Compaq.

**16:48** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Sadly Compaq didn't understand what they'd bought.

**16:52** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

The thing that business people at that time understood about searches that it got people to one place. And then they did not understand that search is a transit point. So they wanted to keep everybody in the search engine so they could show them ads in the search engine.

**17:12** - _Saron Yitbarek_

What Van Couvering is describing is the web portal model that Yahoo and AltaVista both tried out. The vision, a failed vision as it turned out, was to build a walled garden, a complex homepage, a place that attracted people and held on to them so advertisers could display their wares.

**17:31** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

That's not a business model that works for search engines. Search engines need people to come and go, right? A search engine to be good has to cover the whole web, not just the part of the web where you can show advertisements.

**17:47** - _Saron Yitbarek_

And so Compaq had signed AltaVista's death warrant.

**17:51** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

They didn't have any idea how to make this into a real venture, and they didn't want to invest in it. And the clever engineers, the research people of DEC couldn't help them understand, because they also didn't know the business model. But, there wasn't any more research funding coming because Compaq, unlike DEC, was not a research-focused company.

**18:16** - _Saron Yitbarek_

At this point in the late 90s, nobody knew for sure how search was going to be monetized. Marketing teams, for example, we're looking to tweak results for their clients.

**18:27** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

They were poking at AltaVista, and they were poking at Lycos and they were poking at InfoSeek. We now had pressures to potentially make some people look good on results, or how can we give people what they want, or should we sell links? And there was a pressure to include paid for links in the index, and it became a very conflicted space.

**18:50** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Van Couvering's research suggests that the tech of AltaVista was perfectly positioned to succeed, but the executives in charge were not.

**18:59** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

AltaVista had a technically superior search engine, but they did not manage it correctly for the time.

**19:11** - _Saron Yitbarek_

In other words, while there was more and more interest in search, the field was anybody's for the taking. AltaVista could have made a comeback, but that opening was about to snap shut.

**19:25** - _Saron Yitbarek_

When Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998, they weren't thinking about what the marketing department wanted or how they could support a hardware team. They were thinking about the way academics organize their information. Citation analysis. A way to see which material is more cited, more relevant. And they built that approach into their page rank algorithm.

**19:49** - _Elizabeth Van Couvering_

What Brin and Page did was to take that kind of logic and say, "Okay, we are going to look at not just the content of the page." AltaVista and the other search engines up to that time had looked at what was on the page. What was the title of the page? What were the words on the page? But Google looked at the link structure behind the page and identified certain websites as hubs of knowledge.

**20:24** - _Saron Yitbarek_

The indexing was still organic and free in one sense, but it also tracked the value of different pages. It ranked them. This brought an elegance to search, and a usefulness that it never had before.

**20:39** - _Saron Yitbarek_

And Google brought something else, too. Dollar signs. Page rank aside, Cormier reminded us that Google cracked the funding problem AltaVista and the rest never quite figured out.

**20:52** - _Paul Cormier_

Finding the business model, the advertising-based business model, was the thing that made it explode. And as people used it more for free, you needed more everything, more R & D, more systems, more software, more datacenters, everything. And so I think once the advertising model that Google brilliantly put in place, that's really what it took for it to really become what it is today, because it's a huge capital investment and somehow you have to pay for it. It's really easy to say now what a dumb mistake to not come up with an advertising model, but when it's never been done before, it's different, right?

**21:35** - _Saron Yitbarek_

There was a moment that you'll remember, if you're old enough. That moment in the early 2000s, when somebody said, "Hey, you're using the wrong search engine," and then they pointed you toward Google. Converts raced to the new king of search and soon enough it became literally synonymous with search. You didn't just search anymore, you Googled. Nobody was AltaVistaing. Those early years of competition faded into memory. Here's Van Couvering one more time.

**22:39** - _Saron Yitbarek_

Search was always going to be so much more than a side project. So much more than a curiosity in a computer company's research lab. And after Google, we all understood that. In a massively connected world flooded with content, search is what everybody's looking for.

**23:04** - _Saron Yitbarek_

In 2010, Google instant arrived and the search engine started predicting what you were searching for before you finished typing. Advances in AI continue to make the experience more and more intuitive. And it's really become impossible to imagine online life without these tools. But the fundamentals of today's search technology were there in AltaVista. They were imagined into being back in 1995 by pioneers like Louie Monier. He understood that no simple catalog could ever keep up with our sprawling curiosity.

**23:46** - _Saron Yitbarek_

We probably used search engines a few hundred times just while putting this episode together. Just today, I wanted to check up on our guests and in a second, I see Louis Monier just did an interview where they call him the “father of search.” And Larry Page's net worth is, I'm not even going to tell you. And Paul Cormier is, all right, he's the CEO of Red Hat, the company that brings you this podcast.

Next time, we are going global traveling to France, Argentina, and China, to discover how different countries build their own on-ramps to the internet. Until then, I'm Saron Yitbarek and this is Command Line Heroes, an original podcast from Red Hat. Keep on coding.
